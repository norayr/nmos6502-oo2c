nmos6502-oo2c optimizing oberon-2 compiler for nmos6502 platforms

Overview

This is a port of oo2c (Optimizing Oberon-2 Compier) for nmos6502 CPU based platforms.
oo2c (http://ooc.sf.net) frontend generates abstract syntax tree, from which
it's backend generates highly optimized C code.
If you look at the generated C output, you'll notice that code looks more like assembly rather than C.
As it uses C compiler as portable assembler we modified it so it will work with cc65 (www.cc65.org) C compiler for nmos6502 platforms instead of GCC.
Therefore it is possible to generate code for a variety of 6502 platforms supported by cc65 - Apple][, 8 bit Ataris, Oric Atmos, Commodore, etc...
 
This work uses Stewart Greenhill's patch which changes oo2c to produce code for 8bit machines - initially he did it to work with AVR microcontrollers.
He also prepared a  small mini library.
Both oo2c and this mini library were changed in order to compile with cc65, as cc65 is different from gcc.

Now, I have a pleasure to write object oriented programs in Oberon-2 for my favourite little computer - Oric Atmos.

Installation
As oo2c have been written in Oberon, to compile it you need to have oo2c installed
It is ideal to have oo2c-1.5.9, the same version we will compile.
In Debian you may accomplish it with apt-get install oo2c. (fix. it seems in the latest Debians oo2c was removed - no maintainer)
Other dependency, obviously is cc65 c compiler for 6502.
You need to install cc65 first and make sure that it works, and binaries
are in the path.

To compile nmos6502-oo2c from the sources, unpack source archive first

cd nmos6502-oo2c
./build.sh\

It should do all work for you, unpack oo2c-1.5.9 distribution, apply patches, compile compiler, then build a small library
Do not worry about linker messages - it is just cc65 bug dirty workaround, cc65 compiler doesnt create .o files in obj/system and script moves them to the right place 
To make sure your system is supported - search for "hello" file in
/usr/local/nmos-6502/sysname
It seems that library works for all systems except NES.
This seems to be because it is not possile to compile any file
with stdio.h for NES - NES has no plain console library.
Now, to test, run your favourite emulator and load produced hello file
To run on Oric emulator, type CLOAD "hello" that will load the program :)

Usage
let's compile ooptest.Mod
in case target is atmos just type
/usr/local/nmos-6502/atmos-oo2c ooptest

UPD: I did not test it with the recent versions of cc65 and I am not sure that it still works.
